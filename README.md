# Salary Management system (Front-end)
This project was developed to test my .NET and Angular knowledge. Salary Management system consists of 2 applications.

Back-end: salary-management (.NET Core)

Front-end: salary-management-frontend (Angular)

Project Description: Employees will be able to log in and view their personal, work, bank and salary information. Employees are able to update their personal and bank details.
There will also be an administrator who will be in charge of creating employee accounts, updating salaries as well as modifying other information.


## Step 1) Install missing dependencies

Run `npm install` to install node modules.


## Step 2) Development server

Option 1: Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Option 2: If hosting on IIS, set physical path to: `..dist/salary-management` and set port number to 91. Run `npm run build` if you change any code, then restart the website in IIS.
